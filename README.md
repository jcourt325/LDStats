# LDStats

[Go here for graphs.](https://jcourt325.github.io/LDStats/)

This script is intended to be available online, like this, but also to be useable if, for some reason, the site I use for that goes away. Also I wanted to write something in JavaScript since I hadnâ€™t in a while. For those reasons, this script is written entirely in one html file, with one <script>, which you can download and run locally.

It depends only on Chart.js continuing to exist, and the ldjam.com API not changing. If you want to run it locally, download ldStatsTest.html.

The ldjam.com API is currently listed as experimental, so it very well could change. If it does, I may or may not update this, but if someone finds this useful I would encourage you to do so yourself. This wasn't hard to make.

The code here is written lazily, not intended to conform to any particular style, and ChatGPT helped me with Chart.js stuff. I make no promises that the code is good or easy to work with, or even that it works.
